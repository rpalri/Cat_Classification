# Cat Image Classification
Built a deep neural network, and applied it to cat vs non-cat classification.

This project is a part of the course [Neural Networks and Deep Learning on Coursera.com](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome)

## Lessons implemented
1. Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model
2. Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
3. Implement an easy-to-use neural network class
